# sentiment-analysis-project 2020
### Group Members: Hirish Chandrasekaran, Isha Gokhale, Katie Hunyh, Kevin Zhang, Mateo Wang, Priyasha Agarwal.
We plan on creating a machine learning program in order to use sentiment analysis to determine whether news is fake or not and use data science to guide our conclusions and explore our dataset. 

# Abstract
Use a dataset provided by DataFlare: <a href="url">https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/</a> as a starting point for our models. Experiment with different models, starting with a passive agressive classifier.

# Timeline
## Week 3
Explore project group ideas, look at different data sets. Compare ideas.

## Week 4
Finalize project group members, finalize data set, finalize theme and scope of project as it relates to sentiment analysis.

## Week 5
Start unpacking data, analyzing with pandas/numpy.

## Week 6
Begin creating a python program using a passive agressive classifier in sci-kit learn to determine whether news is fake or not. Create plots of data and discuss the efficacy of the model on data set.

## Week 7
Start learning how the underlying passive agressive classifier works, pros and cons, start looking at different models, perhaps using TensorFlow.

# Data Sources
DataFlare, Kaggle

# Technologies
Python (pandas, ski-kit learn, matplotlib) for algorithm and loading/manipulating data. TensorFlow for more advanced models.

# Club Resources needed
Free Food? :D and maybe more members who want to learn or know machine learning.
