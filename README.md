## sentiment-analysis-project 2020
We have created a machine learning program along with TF-IDF preprocessing in order to determine whether the news is fake or not and use data science to guide our conclusions and explore our dataset (FALL). We are currently pursuing more advanced models using PyTorch (WINTER). We'd like to thank Kennard Peters, a stats & ds alumni for his guidance on sci-kit learn and basic data science and Vamshi, a graduate student, for helping with PyTorch. Group Members: Hirish Chandrasekaran, Isha Gokhale, Katie Huynh, Kevin Zhang, Mateo Wang, Priyasha Agarwal.

## Abstract
Use a dataset provided by DataFlare: <a href="url">https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/</a> as a starting point for our models. Experiment with different models, starting with a Passive Aggressive Classification Algorithm.

# Timeline
### Fall Summary
## Week 3: 
Explore project group ideas, look at different data sets. Compare ideas. 
## Week 4: 
Finalize project group members, finalize data set, finalize theme and scope of project as it relates to sentiment analysis. 
## Week 5: 
Start unpacking data, analyzing with pandas/numpy. 
## Week 6 - 9: 
Get aquianted with sci-kit learn, divide group up into two: group (1) purused a naive bayesian classifier approach using sci-kit learn (Isha, Priyasha), group (2)(Hirish, Katie, Kevin) pursued a support vector classifier. Completed a working model, tuned parameters, pickled the SVC model, and commited both model to repository in proper branch.

### Winter Plan
## Week 1
Begin learning PyTorch. Tutorials here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/, neural networks and backpropogation:  https://www.deeplearningbook.org/, in-depth explanation of PyTorch functions:  https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/deep_learning/boosting_models_pytorch/forwardpropagation_backpropagation_gradientdescent/.

# Data Sources
DataFlare, Kaggle

# Technologies
Python (pandas, sci-kit learn, matplotlib) for algorithm and loading/manipulating data. PyTorch and TorchText for more customizable models.
