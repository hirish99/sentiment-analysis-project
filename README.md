## sentiment-analysis-project 2020
We plan on creating a machine learning program along with TF-IDF preprocessing in order to determine whether the news is fake or not and use data science to guide our conclusions and explore our dataset. Group Members: Hirish Chandrasekaran, Isha Gokhale, Katie Huynh, Kevin Zhang, Mateo Wang, Priyasha Agarwal.

## Abstract
Use a dataset provided by DataFlare: <a href="url">https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/</a> as a starting point for our models. Experiment with different models, starting with a Passive Aggressive Classification Algorithm.

# Timeline
### Fall Summary
## Week 3: Explore project group ideas, look at different data sets. Compare ideas. \newline
## Week 4: Finalize project group members, finalize data set, finalize theme and scope of project as it relates to sentiment analysis. \newline
## Week 5: Start unpacking data, analyzing with pandas/numpy. \newline
## Week 6 - 9: Get aquianted with sci-kit learn, divide group up into two: group (1) purused a naive bayesian classifier approach using sci-kit learn (Isha, Priyasha), group (2)(Hirish, Katie, Kevin) pursued a support vector classifier. Completed a working model, tuned parameters, pickled the SVC model, and commited both model to repository in proper branch.

## Winter Plan
# Week 1
Begin learning PyTorch. Tutorials here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/, neural networks and backpropogation:  https://www.deeplearningbook.org/, in-depth explanation of PyTorch functions:  https://www.deeplearningwizard.com/deep_learning/boosting_models_pytorch/forwardpropagation_backpropagation_gradientdescent/.

# Data Sources
DataFlare, Kaggle

# Technologies
Python (pandas, sci-kit learn, matplotlib) for algorithm and loading/manipulating data. PyTorch and TorchText for more customizable models.
